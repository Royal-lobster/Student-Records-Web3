# Storing and Retrieving Student Records using Web3 Technologies with Web User Interface

## Abstract

Securing and issuing academic transcripts is one of the most mind-numbing tasks in the modern world as there are multiple disciplines and manually maintaining the accuracy of the data is tough. Moreover, the data is stored in an untrusted centralized cloud storage system, this type of model possesses a number of issues like high operational cost, data availability, and data security. This project tries to exploit the decentralization and the smart contract feature of the ethereum blockchain. A model where basic student data is stored in a smart contract and large files are stored in IPFS protocol.

## Summary
